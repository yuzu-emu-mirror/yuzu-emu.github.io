## What is yuzu Early Access?
yuzu `Early Access` is a new release channel includes all the same daily yuzu updates that you are accustomed to, plus the early releases of features that you have typically seen in special Patreon releases!
Instead of downloading manual builds from patreon, you'll get these new `Early Access` builds directly via the Installer (future updates included).

#### Step 2
Next, you need to login to your yuzu profile page.
Click on the link given below to proceed.<br>
<a href="https://profile.yuzu-emu.org/" target="_blank"><b>yuzu profile page</b></a><br>

As both Citra and yuzu share a common Discourse forum, you'll have to either log in with those credentials or create a new account there.
Users also have the option of signing in using their existing Google or GitHub account.</i></b></p>

#### Step 6
Next, download and run the latest version of the Installer: [**Click here to download.**](https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/)
You should see an option to select the `Early Access` release channel. 

**Note:** `Early Access` includes all the same features and updates as the regular yuzu, so you donâ€™t need to install both!

On the next page of the installer, paste the token you previously copied in `Step 4` by selecting the `Token Entry Box` and pressing `CTRL + V` on your keyboard, and then click `Verify Token` to authenticate.

As long as you keep your Patreon subscription valid, you will continue to receive Patreon-specific updates, as well as regular yuzu updates, automatically by just running `yuzu Early Access` from your Start menu.
