Boxcat is an open-source replacement for Nintendo's BCAT service. BCAT is a network service that games can leverage to add dynamic content to games. Some examples of features games make use of this for are Splatoon 2 Splatfests, Splatoon 2 course rotations, Super Mario Odyssey costumes, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate news, and even the news feed on the home menu. By emulating the BCAT service at a high-level, yuzu is able to intercept the game's calls to Nintendo's servers and reroute them to yuzu's servers.

## Current Boxcat Events

### Super Mario Odyssey

The satellaview and baseball costumes are available for purchase in the shop if you haven't already bought them and the filter, tile, and kaleidoscope screenshot filters are now available.
