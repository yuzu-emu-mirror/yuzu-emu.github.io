## Hardware Requirements

|   	|  CPU 	|  GPU	|  RAM	|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|**Minimum**|Intel Core i5-4430 / AMD Ryzen 3 1200|Intel HD Graphics 520 / NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 2GB / AMD Radeon R7 240 2GB|8GB|
|**Recommended**|Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600|Intel UHD Graphics 630 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4GB / AMD Radeon RX Vega 56 8GB|16GB| 

- Our recommended specifications don't guarantee perfect performance in most games, but rather strive to provide a cost effective recommendation while still considering performance.

- Most games are playable on older Nvidia GPUs from the Fermi family (400 series) or later, but at least Pascal (1000 series) is strongly recommended.

- CPUs lacking the FMA instruction set will produce very poor results. Intel Core gen 3 series or older, AMD phenom II or older and all Pentium/Celeron/Atom CPUs will not produce optimal results.

- Mobile CPUs will not reach the same performance as their desktop counterparts due to thermal, power, and technical limitations. 

- **GPUs must support OpenGL 4.6 & OpenGL Compatibility profile, or Vulkan 1.1 (or higher).**<br>
To find out if your GPU meets these requirements, visit https://opengl.gpuinfo.org or https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/ and check your GPU details.<br>

## yuzu Quickstart Guide

To start playing commercial games, yuzu needs a couple of system files and folders from your switch in order to play them properly.
To check if your Switch is hackable, visit https://damota.me/ssnc/checker and test your Switch's serial number.

<article class="message has-text-weight-semibold">
    <div class="message-body">
        <p>NOTE:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your Switch is patched, you will be unable to complete the following steps.</li>
            <li>The 2019 Switch revision (Mariko/Red Box/HAC-001(-01)) and the Switch Lite are both patched and you will not be able to complete the following steps.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</article>

This guide will help you copy all your system files, games, updates, and DLC from your switch to your computer and organize them in a format yuzu understands.
This process should take about 60 to 90 minutes.

**IMPORTANT:**  
**Make sure to place your Nintendo Switch into Airplane Mode before starting this guide.**  
`System Settings -> Airplane Mode -> Airplane Mode "ON"`

## Prerequisites

- A Nintendo Switch vulnerable to the fusée gelée RCM exploit -- Visit https://damota.me/ssnc/checker and test your Switch's serial number

`%YUZU_DIR%` is the home directory for yuzu on your computer:

    - For Windows, this is '%APPDATA%\yuzu' or 'C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\yuzu'
    - For Linux, this is '~/.local/share/yuzu'

## Preparing the microSD Card

1. We will now prepare the microSD card.
    - 1a. Extract the contents inside the `atmosphere-X.X.X-master-XXXXXXXX+hbl-X.X.X+hbmenu-X.X.X.zip` and `hekate_ctcaer_X.X.X_Nyx_X.X.X.zip` files into the root of your microSD card. Just drag and drop the contents, do not create any new folders.
    - 1b. Rename the `hekate_ctcaer_X.X.X.bin` file to `reboot_payload.bin` and move it into the `atmosphere` folder. Replace the file when prompted.
    - 1c. Place the `fusee-primary.bin`, `Lockpick_RCM.bin` and `TegraExplorer.bin` files into the `payloads` folder, which is inside the `bootloader` folder in your microSD card.
    - 1d. Create a folder named `nxdumptool` within the `switch` folder of your SD card and place the `nxdumptool.nro` file inside it.
    - 1e. Once done, eject the microSD card and insert it into your Nintendo Switch.

## Booting into RCM

2. We will now boot your Nintendo Switch into RCM mode
    - 2a. Run the TegraRcmGUI installer you downloaded from the prerequisites, and after installation, start the program. 
    - 2b. In the `Settings` tab, click on `Install Driver` which will install the drivers necessary for your computer to interface with your Nintendo Switch. 
    - 2c. After the drivers have been installed, plug your Nintendo Switch into your computer.
    - 2d. Power off your Switch while it is still connected to your computer.
    - 2e. Insert your RCM jig into the right joy-con slot, make sure it is seated securely at the base, and then press VOL+ and Power buttons at the same time. Nothing should happen on your Switch; if the switch starts to turn on normally, go back to the beginning of step 2d and try again.
    - 2f. If you see the Nintendo Switch icon in the lower left corner flash green and state `RCM O.K.`, your switch has successfully entered RCM mode.

## Booting into Hekate

3. We will now boot your Nintendo Switch (already in [RCM mode](#booting-into-rcm)) into Hekate, a custom bootloader.
    - 3a. Extract the `hekate_ctcaer_X.X.X.bin` file from the `hekate_ctcaer_X.X.X_Nyx_X.X.X.zip` file you downloaded from the prerequisites to any accessible directory on your computer.
    - 3b. Run TegraRcmGUI. In the `Payload` tab of TegraRcmGUI, click on the folder icon and navigate to the `hekate_ctcaer_X.X.X.bin` file you extracted earlier.
    - 3c. Click on `Inject Payload` and your Switch will boot into the Hekate menu.
    
## Mounting the microSD card to your computer in Hekate

_**NOTE:** These steps will be used in other sections below. Do **not** follow this section yet if you are [booted into Hekate for the first time.](#booting-into-rcm) Skip to the [next section](#dumping-prod-keys-and-title-keys) for now._

4. We will now mount the microSD card as a drive from your Switch to your computer in Hekate, via USB.
    - 4a. In the Hekate Home menu, tap on the `Tools` tab to show the Tools menu.
