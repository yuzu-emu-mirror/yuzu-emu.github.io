~~**Note: Currently saving levels causes yuzu to crash, due to a swkbd (software keyboard) issue. But rest assured, we are working on a fix.**~~
The issue with the software keyboard has now been fixed. Please download the latest build from our patreon page.

Please hop on Discord and use the Patreon channels to report any new bugs, or to just say Hi and discuss the new features.

Until next time, keep playing on yuzu and have fun! <br>
