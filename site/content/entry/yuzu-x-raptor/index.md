We are saddened to report that we have removed online support from yuzu, indefinitely, and effective immediately. 
We apologize to our community for the confusion and disappointment surrounding this release, and especially to those who were excited to try this feature.

We have received valid and insightful feedback from our fans and members of the broader Switch and emulation communities. 
Truthfully, we are all just a bunch of enthusiastic people from around the globe, who were genuinely excited about something we thought we could offer. 
In hindsight, we 100% understand your concerns.

As always, we will continue working on other features and improvements within yuzu, to make it the best emulator we possibly can. 
Thank you to everyone who has continued to support us, provided us feedback and been open to constructive discussion on this topic. 
Now, as always, we value your opinions.

â€“ The yuzu development team
